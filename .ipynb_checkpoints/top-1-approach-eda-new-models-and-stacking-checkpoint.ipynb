    "\n",
    "Hello all! In this notebook I'm going to implement what I gained on the way of learning. I'm doing this for learning purposes and share back to community what I learned. So there might be areas can be improved in future.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### My main objectives on this project are:\n",
    "+ Applying exploratory data analysis and trying to get some insights about our dataset\n",
    "+ Getting data in better shape by transforming and feature engineering to help us in building better models\n",
    "+ Building and tuning couple models to get some stable results on predicting housing prices\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In this notebook we are going to try explore the data we have and going try answer questions like:\n",
    "+ What are the main predictors for house pricing?\n",
    "+ What is more important on pricing, having big area for housing or just being in better neighborhood?\n",
    "+ Is quality of the house alone more important than having nice garages or basements?\n",
    "+ There are some features that can be modified and depends on the building but there are some other features like cannot be changed like location of the house, which group is effecting house prices?\n",
    "+ Can we predict the price of a house with the given traning data using machine learning techniques.\n",
    "+ What can our predictions achieve with different approaches?\n",
    "+ If we stack and blend the models, can we get more regularized results?\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Neighborhood;**\n",
    " - Northridge Heights, Northridge and Timberland are top 3 expensive places for houses.\n",
    " - Somerset, Veenker, Crawford, Clear Creek, College Creek and Bloomington Heights seems above average.\n",
    " - Sawyer West has wide range for prices related to similar priced regions.\n",
    " - Old Town and Edwards has some outlier prices but they generally below average.\n",
    " - Briardale, Iowa DOT and Rail Road, Meadow Village are the cheapest places for houses it seems...\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Conditions;**\n",
    " - Meanwhile having wide range of values being close to North-South Railroad seems having positive effect on the price.\n",
    " - Being near or adjacent to positive off-site feature (park, greenbelt, etc.) increases the price.\n",
    " - These values are pretty similar but we can get some useful information from them.\n",
    " \n",
    "- **MasVnrType;** Having stone masonry veneer seems better priced than having brick.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Quality Features;** There are many categorical quality values that affects the pricing on some degree, we're going to quantify them so we can create new features based on them. So we don't dive deep on them in this part.\n",

    "  - Car ports are the lowest\n",
